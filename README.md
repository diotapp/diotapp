## Featured Project: AquaPredict

### Project Overview:  
**AquaPredict** is a machine learning system developed to predict lake water quality based on meteorological data. This project aims to optimize water treatment processes for industrial enterprises relying on lakes as open water sources.

### Why It Matters:  
The quality of lake water has a direct impact on the cost and efficiency of water treatment. Pollution and environmental changes affect water quality, making accurate predictions essential for planning and reducing treatment costs.

### Data Overview:

| Data Type             | Description                       |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Meteorological Data**| Historical weather data           |
| **_fact**             | Actual water quality data         |
| **_pm01**             | Prediction Model #1               |
| **_pm02**             | Prediction Model #2               |
| **_pm03**             | Prediction Model #3               |

**Technologies Used**: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, TensorFlow, Docker
